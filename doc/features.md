# Features

The CROWler is a comprehensive web crawling and scraping tool designed to
perform various tasks related to web content discovery and data collection.
Here is a detailed list of its features along with their descriptions and
benefits:

1. **Web Crawling**:

   - **Recursive Crawling**: Supports deep crawling of websites, following
     links recursively to discover new content.
     - *Benefits*: Enables thorough exploration of websites to uncover hidden
       pages and data.

   - **Human Browsing Mode**: Simulates human-like browsing behavior to access
     content that might be blocked by automated bots. This is part of the HBS
     (Human Behavior Simulation) architecture.
     - *Benefits*: Helps in bypassing basic bot detection mechanisms to access
       dynamic content.

   - **Fuzzing Mode**: Automatically tests web pages for various inputs to
     discover hidden functionalities and vulnerabilities.
     - *Benefits*: Aids in security testing by discovering potential weaknesses
       in web applications.

   - **Customizable Browsing Speed**: Allows users to configure the speed of
     crawling to avoid overloading servers, being detected, or triggering
     anti-bot mechanisms. Speed is also configurable at runtime and per source,
     allowing for more human-like behavior.
     - *Benefits*: Prevents excessive traffic to target websites, ensuring
       minimal impact on their performance and stability, while reducing the
       risk of being blocked.

   - **Human Behavior Simulation (HBS)**: A system architecture designed to
     mimic human-like browsing patterns to avoid detection by anti-bot systems.
     - *Benefits*: Enhances low-noise operations and reduces the risk of being
       blocked by websites and proxy services.

   - **Dynamic Content Handling**: Supports the execution of JavaScript to
      access dynamically generated content.
      - *Benefits*: Allows access to content that is rendered dynamically by
        client-side scripts.

   - **Keywords Extraction**: Extracts keywords from web pages to identify
     relevant topics and themes.
     - *Benefits*: Helps in categorizing and organizing content for analysis
       and indexing. Keywords can also be used in Security Searches and Events
       to identify Sources of Interest.

   - **Site language detection**: Detects the language of a website to support
     multilingual crawling and content analysis. Even in absence of language
     tags, the CROWler can detect the language of a page.
     - *Benefits*: Facilitates language-specific processing and analysis of
       web content.

   - **Content Analysis**: Analyzes the content of web pages to extract
      metadata, entities, and other structured information.
      - *Benefits*: Provides insights into the content of web pages for
        categorization, indexing, and analysis.

2. **Web Scraping**:

   - **Customizable Scraping Rules**: Users can define specific rules for data
     extraction using CSS selectors, XPath, and other methods.
     - *Benefits*: Provides flexibility to extract specific data points from
       web pages as per user requirements.

   - **Post-Processing of Scraped Data**: Includes steps to transform, clean,
     and validate data after extraction, as well as to enrich it with
     additional information, metadata, and annotations using plugins and AI
     models.
     - *Benefits*: Ensures the quality and usability of the collected data.

3. **Action Execution**:

   - **Automated Interactions**: Can perform actions like clicking, filling
     forms, and navigating websites programmatically. Actions are executed at
     the SYSTEM level, making the CROWler undetectable by most anti-bot
     systems. This is part of the HBS (Human Behavior Simulation) architecture.
     - *Benefits*: Enables the automation of repetitive tasks, improving
       efficiency in data collection.

   - **Advanced Interactions**: Supports complex interactions like drag-and-drop,
     mouse hover, and keyboard inputs.
     - *Benefits*: Allows handling of sophisticated user interface elements
       that require advanced manipulation.

4. **Technology Detection**:

   - **Framework and Technology Identification**: Uses detection rules to
     identify technologies, frameworks, and CMS used by websites.
